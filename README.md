# Employee Performance and Productivity Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of employee performance and productivity using the dataset "Extended Employee Performance and Productivity Data." The aim is to extract insights, identify key performance indicators, and explore patterns that can help improve workplace efficiency and decision-making.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Initial inspection and cleaning of the dataset to ensure data accuracy and quality.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representations such as bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots to highlight trends, correlations, and outliers.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Application of machine learning models like linear regression and classification to predict employee productivity and performance.
- **Key Insights**: Identification of significant factors (e.g., work hours, experience, etc.) that impact employee performance and productivity.

## Dataset
The dataset contains extended employee performance and productivity data with various attributes, such as work hours, experience, performance scores, and more. It provides the necessary information to conduct a thorough analysis of employee efficiency.

## Requirements
To replicate the analysis, you will need the following:

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`, `joblib`

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
